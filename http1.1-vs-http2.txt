HTTP1.1 ---> It is the older sibling, operates on a simple principle: one request at a time. When you open a webpage, it sends multiple requests for different resources (like images, stylesheets, and scripts) one after another. This sequential process can lead to a phenomenon known as head-of-line blocking, where a slow-loading resource delays the entire page.

HTTP2 ---> It is the modern solution to this problem. Unlike its predecessor, HTTP/2 allows multiple requests and responses to occur concurrently through a single connection. It introduces a feature called multiplexing, enabling the browser to request and receive multiple resources in parallel. This results in a faster and more efficient loading experience, as resources can be delivered simultaneously without waiting for one to finish before starting the next.
