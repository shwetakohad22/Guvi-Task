JavaScript works by using objects, which are like building blocks for organizing information. Inside, JavaScript uses property descriptors and prototype chains to represent objects. Property descriptors keep details about properties, like what they are and how they work. Prototype chains connect objects to their prototypes, making it easy to share properties. To create objects, people use different methods like simple names, the Object tool, or special functions. The system also takes care of memory by cleaning up things not being used, called garbage collection. Knowing how these things work helps developers make good, easy-to-understand code. In just 150 words, we've looked at the inside workings of JavaScript objects, making web development feel a bit like magic.
